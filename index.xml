      <description>Tear Down the Wall (of text) This weeks blog post will be tackling the issue that everyone has probably faced at one time or another. The issue of how much text should be on a worship slide, sermon graphic or even a postcard mailout.
It is normal to want to put as much information as possible into a design especially when it is something that will be used to advertise an event or special service.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the End Bad Design blog My name is Anthony Roberts and I hope that anyone involved in creative ministries at their church can benefit from this blog.
Most of you probably attend a church like me and do not have a large budget for your printing, graphic design and other creative services. Maybe you are the entire creative department by yourself.
Regardless of your situation or department size, there are many things you can do to make your church design better.</description>
