        <p>This week will be a continuation of last weeks post on <a href="http://endbaddesign.com/blog/church-websites/" title="Church Websites">Church Websites</a>. Last week focused on the function of your website, and what information is important for you to display. Now we can focus on making your website more aesthetically pleasing to the people viewing it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have the budget for a professional designer, how can we have a better-looking site?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the question I get asked the most. It would be nice if every church had the budget to pay a professional to develop their website, but that is just not the case with most churches. With today&rsquo;s ever changing technology, you can still get a quality looking site without hiring a professional web developer or spending a lot of money. If you have enough technical knowledge to operate Microsoft Office, you can build a modern looking website for your church that is easy to use and meets all of the important requirements with a few available tools.</p>

<p>Before we get into designing a website yourself, I will give you a few pointers when looking to hire a professional designer if you decide to go that route.</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t always assume the cheapest price is the best price. You tend to get what you pay for in website design and if someone is giving you a price below the market average, either they are trying to bless you as a church or do not know what they are doing.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t always assume the highest price is going to give you the highest quality. On the opposite end of the spectrum, some people charge a lot of money for the quality of work they offer.</li>
<li>Always ask to see their portfolio and most recent sites they have built. Make sure what you have in mind for your site to look like is something that they can do.</li>
<li>Be upfront about everything you want on your site. The quickest way to go over budget with a designer is to keep adding things to the project after you have received a quote. Also, be sure that if you are needing some custom functions, that they have the capabilities of building those functions and how much extra cost will it add to your site.</li>
<li>Make sure they can design your site to be mobile friendly and responsive</li>
<li>Listen to their advice. If they tell you that something you would like to add to your site is a not a good idea, chances are they are right. If they are a good designer with plenty of experience, they will know what hurts and what helps a website.</li>
<li>Ask if they can add Google Analytics tracking to your website.</li>
<li>Follow the timelines they give you on sending them content and images. I have designed websites for churches that were 99% complete, but they launched weeks behind schedule because they would not send me the last bit of information I needed to complete their site.</li>
<li>Be honest with your designer. If they send you a preview and you dislike the color scheme, let them know. If the layout is not exactly like you wanted, ask them why not and if there is a technical reason to why it is different. When you wait till after a project is completed to ask your designer to make changes, you are going to be charged extra and changes after something was originally signed off on can be costly.</li>
</ul>

<p>For those of you that want to design your website yourself, here are some things that will help you.</p>

<p><strong>Determine what kind of Content Management System (CMS) you would like to use</strong>
This is a very crucial step in creating your church website. The CMS you choose will be the foundation upon the entire site is built on. Using one that is too complicated will lead to frustration and a poorly designed site. If you are needing custom options, make sure that your CMS of choice can handle custom design along with their default options.</p>

<p><strong>CMS Options</strong> Here are a few of the most popular options to check out for church websites. I will try to describe my personal experiences with each one, and the pros and cons of each. Most all of these have a free demo that you can try. This will let you see if it is right for you.</p>

<p><em>Wordpress</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>WordPress powers more than 28% of the web — a figure that rises every day. Everything from simple websites, to blogs, to complex portals and enterprise websites, and even applications, are built with WordPress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hands down, Wordpress is the biggest CMS on the internet and a popular choice for churches. Out of all the popular CMS options, I have had the most experience with Wordpress.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Very easy to get up and running. Most all web hosting companies have a 1-click install option for Wordpress.</li>
<li>Endless amounts of themes. You can get a very well designed theme installed in your Wordpress site and simply fill in the blanks with your information. I would suggest staying away from most free themes as they tend to not be supported after a while. <a href="https://theme.co/x/" title="XTheme">&ldquo;X-Theme&rdquo;</a> is a widely used theme for churches. It is very customizable and updated regularly. This premium theme is well worth the money.</li>
<li>Lots of plugins. You can get a lot of features on your Wordpress site such as media players, videos, audio, contact forms etc by simply installing a plugin from the Wordpress dashboard.</li>
<li>Adding content and keeping your site updated is very easy. If you can type in a word processor, you will have no problem using the Wordpress editor.</li>
<li>Lots of support and tutorials are available online.</li>
<li>Responsive design by default.</li>
<li>Easy to maintain and add new content.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Some people may find all of the features overwhelming at first.</li>
<li>Some third party plugins and themes are not maintained and can lead to security issues.</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t know how to code PHP and you try to edit the core code files in Wordpress, you are going to have massive headaches.</li>
<li>Premium themes and plugins can be costly.</li>
<li>You have to stay on top of security updates. Wordpress is very popular with hackers. If you keep it updated regularly you should never have an issue, just don&rsquo;t forget about your updates.</li>
<li>If you install a lot of custom features on your Wordpress site, you will experience slower load times than other CMS.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Squarespace</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Squarespace is a way to build websites. For an annual or monthly subscription, we provide access to a set of templates and tools you can use to design your own site—no coding or web development experience required.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Squarespace is starting to really gain popularity in the realm of church websites. It is very user-friendly and is an all-in-one package that takes a headache out of purchasing separate domains, hosting and emails.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>No special software or developer knowledge required.</li>
<li>Includes your domain name, hosting, email and some image licensing for a flat yearly fee.</li>
<li>Lots of templates to choose from.</li>
<li>Responsive design that is mobile friendly out of the box.</li>
<li>Easy to update and add content</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Not as flexible or customizable as other CMS. If you need to program custom features, Squarespace is not for you</li>
<li>While there are a lot of templates to choose from, a lot of people end up using the most popular ones and your site can end up looking like every other Squarespace site. This is not always a bad thing unless you are trying to really stand out.</li>
<li>It can be hard to import/export your existing site or content because Squarespace is a unique platform.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Clover Sites</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone says that their content management system is easy. But when it comes down to it, you still have to be a designer to make it look good, or you have to hire a programmer to figure it out. We built the Greenhouse with real people in mind. So with our Easy and Advanced Modes, editing your site is both incredibly simple and remarkably flexible. -Clover Sites</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clover Sites is a CMS that was specifically designed for churches. This makes it a very good platform choice to build your site on. They also offer a flat-fee package that includes everything you need to build a modern looking website.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Built specifically for churches.</li>
<li>Easy and intuitive to use.</li>
<li>Very customizable with a drag and drop editor, no coding required.</li>
<li>Responsive and mobile friendly right out of the box.</li>
<li>All in one package deal that includes everything you need to get started.</li>
<li>Updated regularly and very secure</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>More expensive than other CMS options and has a high up front cost.</li>
<li>Unique platform so it may be hard to transfer to another CMS if you choose.</li>
<li>May be hard to find a plug-in or add-on for custom features.</li>
</ul>

<p>While these are not the only CMS options out there, these are the three most popular ones I have seen from churches and hopefully one of these will be suitable for your needs.</p>

<p>I will leave you with a couple of tips for your church website.</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep it simple. Don&rsquo;t clutter your site with a bunch irrelevant information. Show the important stuff and leave the rest for when they walk through your doors.</li>
<li>Photo gallery are dead. Post a few <em>recent</em> pictures of your facilities and members with smiling faces. Save the event photo galleries for your social media.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t autoplay videos, especially ones with sound. There is nothing worse than being surprised by a super loud noise while loading your site.</li>
<li>Background music should be a sin. It&rsquo;s annoying and worsens your performance. This isn&rsquo;t Myspace.</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t have a decent photographer or designer in your church, hire one to make your website photos and graphics. Nothing says &ldquo;we have no idea what we are doing&rdquo; quite like timestamps and dates on your photos, out of focus images and Word Art text over your photos.</li>
<li>Nobody is impressed with flashy website intros and 10 different slides cycling on your homepage. Narrow it down to the important stuff.</li>
<li>Check your website with performance tools such as <a href="http://nibbler.silktide.com/" title="Silktide">Silktide</a>, <a href="https://seositecheckup.com/" title="SEO Site Checkup">SEO Site Checkup</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" title="Googe Page Speed">Google Page Speed</a></li>
</ul>
