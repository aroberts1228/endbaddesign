<h1 id="everyone-loves-free-stuff">Everyone loves free stuff</h1>

<p>Welcome to Free Stuff Friday. If you are like me you probably have quite the collection of fonts on your computer. I use quite a mix of premium and free fonts in my work.</p>

<p>It is good to have a variety of fonts for different situations. Some fancier fonts look great in digital designs, while others used in print need to be clean and easy to read.</p>

<p>This is in no way a comprehensive list of the fonts I own and use, or even close to the number of fonts you can find in various places online. It is simply a list of the fonts I find myself using the most and the good thing is that they are all 100% free.</p>

<p>Take a look, download them and send me a message letting me know how they worked out for you.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="img/fontsbebas1.jpg" alt="Bebas" /></p>

<p>Bebas is one of my favorite go-to fonts for design work. It is a very easy to read sans-serif font that looks good in digital and print design. If you have never tried this font before, I think you will find yourself using it quite a bit. This font is only available in all caps, so that may affect your usage.
<a href="http://www.dafont.com/bebas-kai.font" title="Bebas">Download Bebas</a></p>

<p><img src="img/fontsbigjohn.jpg" alt="Big John, Slim Joe" /></p>

<p>Big John/Slim Joe comes as a combination of two fonts. Both of these fonts are all caps only. Designed to be used together, they make a perfect pair for designs. I will usually put Big John as a header with Slim Joe as the content underneath. Give these two a try together or by themselves, you will not be disappointed.
<a href="https://befonts.com/big-john-slim-joe-font.html" title="Big John/Slim Joe">Download Big John/Slim Joe</a></p>

<p><img src="img/fontsskmodernist.jpg" alt="SK Modernist" /></p>

<p>SK-Modernist is my most used font on this list. It is available in bold and regular weights as well as a mono-spaced font variation. SK-Modernist is so clean and elegant you will find yourself using it on everything from print designs to logos and everything in between. You simply cannot beat this font for free.
<a href="http://seankanedesign.com/work/sk-modernist" title="SK-Modernist">Download SK-Modernist</a></p>

<p><img src="img/fontsailerons.jpg" alt="Ailerons" /></p>

<p>Ailerons is a unique font that you may not use all of the time but will work great for titles on sermon slides and headings on print materials. It is not the easiest font to read in paragraph form but used in the right application it can really stand out.
<a href="https://befonts.com/ailerons-typeface.html" title="Ailerons">Download Ailerons</a></p>

<p><img src="img/fontscoolvetica.jpg" alt="Coolvetica" /></p>

<p>Coolvetica is a variation of the iconic Helvetica font. This font has a little more flair than the original but still has a variety of uses. I really like the lowercase letters a lot in this font. Download it for free and try it out. If you already have Helvetica, this can give you a little less serious look when you need it.
<a href="http://www.dafont.com/coolvetica.font" title="Coolvetica">Download Coolvetica</a></p>

<p><img src="img/fontsopensans.jpg" alt="Open Sans" /></p>

<p>Open Sans is probably one of the most used fonts on the internet. You can use it on your website through Google Fonts, or you can download it and use it anywhere in your designs. It is very easy to read and comes in a wide variety of weights so the applications are endless.
<a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans" title="Open Sans">Download Open Sans</a></p>

<p><img src="img/fontsmontserrat.jpg" alt="Montserrat" /></p>

<p>Montserrat is another font that comes in a multitude of weights and sizes. Much like Open Sans, it is very easy to read and has a lot of great applications. If you have a lot of content, consider this font as it is easy on the eyes in paragraph form.
<a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/montserrat" title="Montserrat">Download Montserrat</a></p>

<p><img src="img/fontsroboto.jpg" alt="Roboto" /></p>

<p>Roboto is the default font on Android and Chrome OS, and the recommended font for Google’s visual language, Material Design. Roboto may be simple but because it comes in a wide variety of weights, you can use it on websites, print designs or even motion design. This one is well worth keeping in your font book.
<a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto" title="Roboto">Download Roboto</a></p>

<p><img src="img/fontsraleway.jpg" alt="Raleway" /></p>

<p>Raleway is a classic and elegant font that pairs well with many other fonts. You can use it as a Google Font for your website or download it for use in any project you may be working on. The signature &ldquo;W&rdquo; really adds a little uniqueness to this font and stands out just a little, but not too much.
<a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/raleway" title="Raleway">Download Raleway</a></p>

<p><img src="img/fontsrex.jpg" alt="Rex" /></p>

<p>Rex has become my go-to vintage looking font. It is only available in all caps but does include an inline version that really gives it a retro fill. If you are into hipster vintage looking logos, Rex is a font you really should consider trying.
<a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/rex" title="Rex">Download Rex</a></p>

<p><img src="img/fontsvincent.jpg" alt="Vincent" /></p>

<p>Vincent is another retro or vintage all caps font that can be used in a wide variety of design projects. It reminds me of a vintage sports team font or something you would see an older college using. I have personally used Vincent several times in flyers as it makes a really good heading.
<a href="http://www.dafontfree.net/freefonts-vincent-f86386.htm" title="Vincent">Download Vincent</a></p>

<p><img src="img/fontslato.jpg" alt="Lato" /></p>

<p>Lato is very similar to Open Sans and Montserrat. It makes a great web font in addition to using it in your print media as well. When you need a good clean sans-serif font, keep Lato in mind.
<a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/lato" title="Lato">Download Lato</a></p>

<hr />

<p>I hope this list has given you some new fonts to try out. If you already have these fonts and use them, I would suggest you take a look <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design-tips/best-free-fonts-for-designers-1233380" title="Creative Bloq Fonts">Here</a>. This is a comprehensive list of 50 free fonts for designers. I discovered the majority of these fonts listed here from places like Creative Bloq. While it may be easy to get stuck using the same fonts over and over because you know they work, do yourself a favor and branch out a little. You might just surprise yourself by what a new font can do to your design work.</p>
