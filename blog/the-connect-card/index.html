<h3 id="the-connect-card">The Connect Card</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the connect card, info card, guest card, visitor information card, follow up card or whatever name you might use to get contact information from your guest.</p>

<p>Connect cards are something that you usually have designed, print a couple thousand of and then you never think about them again. You get used to seeing them, the staff gets used to them and sometimes your guest quit filling them out. Like most things, they should be evaluated ever so often and updated to fit with the growth of your church.</p>

<p>Below is an example of the connect cards we have had for years at my church and just recently designed them.</p>

<p><img src="img/connectcardold.jpg" alt="original connect card" /></p>

<p>This version of our card served its purpose for quite a few years. The problem we had is that fewer people were filling them out all the way and they were not being turned in. After much deliberation on the subject we decided that maybe our card was too lengthy.</p>

<p>When this card had been designed, our church was quite a bit smaller in size and so we had a one size fits all card. These connect cards were not only for guest information but also served as a sign up for ministry, prayer request, more information regarding the church and bible study sign up.</p>

<p>These are printed on 4&rdquo;x6&rdquo; postcards and the majority of people upon seeing it was front and back would not take the time to fill them out simply because at a glance it seemed like you had to fill out the entire card. The problem we faced with simplifing our card is that all of the information that was currently on the card was important. So how do you condense your connect card while still retaining the important information that you need to gather? <a href="https://prochurchtools.com/perfect-church-connection-card-examples/" title="Pro Church Tools">Pro Church Tools</a> has written an excellent article, that I highly suggest reading, that addresses the information issue.</p>

<p>What I would like to do in this post is walk you through the steps we took in our connect card redesign and at the end of the post I will provide a link where you can download the PSD files of our connect cards.</p>

<p>The first step we took was to look over our original card and decide what the most important info was for us to keep. After that we looked at the information that had not been updated in a while or that had changed. After several weeks of back and forth we decided to split our front and back single connect card into four different one sided cards. Each card has been assaigned a different bold color and is labled on the front CONNECT, FOLLOW, SERVE and KIDS.</p>

<p>Our first card we will look at is labeled <strong>CONNECT</strong></p>

<p><img src="img/connectcardnew.jpg" alt="new connect card" /></p>

<p>As you can see it is simplified greatly over our original connect card. We kept only the relevant information fields to get someone connected to the church. Here is a list of information fields we kept and a description of why we use them. Rememember, every church is different and you have to find out what works for your community.</p>

<p><strong>Name</strong> - This one is obvious, but you need someone&rsquo;s name. We contemplated adding a blank for spouse so that families could fill out one card, but then we would need to add more blanks for separate email addresses. The thought process is that if you make the card simple enough and a couple would not mind filling out separate cards.</p>

<p><strong>Email</strong> - Our main form of contact at church is email, so it is very important that we have this field for someone to fill out. However, we do not spam people and we do not add anyone to our regular email list without them opting in.</p>

<p><strong>Phone</strong> - While the phone number is not our most important piece of information, we still like to personally call our first time guest after they have attended our church. It is an easy way to follow up and thank them for choosing to visit our church.</p>

<p><strong>Address</strong> - Most people would agree that traditional snail mail is outdated and the majority of people do not even open mail unless it looks official. However, our pastor hand writes a thank you letter to every first time guest at our church and we have noticed that this makes a huge impact. This can also make them more aware of postcards and flyers we send out advertising events.</p>

<p><strong>Children</strong> - We decided to list a few blanks where people could write the names of their children. This allows us to communicate to our Sunday School teachers, Student Pastor and Childrens Pastor about potential new students that may be attending.</p>

<p><strong>How did you hear about us</strong> - It is important to know where your guest are hearing about your church. This allows you to make educated decisions about future marketing strategies. Is the majority of your traffic coming from online interactions? Are people noticing your sign out front when they drive by? Are guest being invited by church members and word of mouth in the community?</p>

<p>The next card we designed is the <strong>FOLLOW</strong> card.</p>

<p><img src="img/connectcardfollow.jpg" alt="new follow card" /></p>

<p>Having eliminated everything but contact information from our connect card we had to come up with another card for people wanting to further their spiritual connection to the church. These cards are aimed at people who would like to let our leaders know about a prayer request that they have, sign up for ministry training in our LIFE classes or be baptized.</p>

<p>The contact for our follow card have also been simplified to the person&rsquo;s name and email since that is our primary form of contact for the church and all that is needed in these situations. There is no need to complicate it by asking for all of their information all over again.</p>

<p>These are our primary points of interest, but remember that just because something works great at one church doesn&rsquo;t always mean it will work great at yours. There is nothing wrong with sitting down and mapping your card out in advance. Do some small runs to experiment and see what gets the best results.</p>

<p>Our next card is the <strong>SERVE</strong> card.</p>

<p><img src="img/connectcardserve.jpg" alt="new serve Card" /></p>

<p>The Serve card allows someone who is looking to volunteer or serve at my church to easily get their information into the hands of the appropriate team leader.</p>

<p>Like our Follow card, the only contact information fields are name and email. Below the name and email are four of our main ministry teams <em>First Impressions</em> (Greeters, Guest Services, Ushers), <em>Support</em> (Security, Event Set-up/Tear-down), <em>Production</em> (Lighting, Sound, Media, Photo/Video), <em>Worship</em> (Musician, Singer) and then our Children and Student Ministries are listed.</p>

<p>Once this card has been filled out and turned in, the contact information will be passed on to the team leader of that ministry for them to follow up with the potential volunteer.</p>

<p>Our last card is the <strong>KIDS</strong> card.</p>

<p>This is a fun card that I came up with to get our younger guest involved. Typically only the adults will fill out a connect card in church. I wanted a way for the kids to feel like they were a part of the experience of visiting a church for the first time as well.</p>

<p>For the kids version of a connect card there is no reason to get as much information as you do from adults. The younger kids may not even have an email address or know their phone number. With this in mind we decided to keep it simple.</p>

<p><img src="img/connectcardkids.jpg" alt="new kids card" /></p>

<p>The only information fields are their name and address (for the ones that know it), this way our Sunday School Teachers and Student Ministers can mail them a postcard or letter.</p>

<p>To make these fun we added a lot of blank space with the instructions at the top <em>Draw a picture of yourself</em>. The idea came from eating at a restaurant as a kid where they would hang your kids menu paper that you colored up at the front counter. We can now do the same thing with our Sunday School rooms displaying the pictures that the kids have drawn.</p>

<p>Hopefully our re-designed connect cards can give you some insight and ideas for you to use at your church. Feel free to use these cards as they are or modify them to fit your church or ministry. They are designed as full bleed print ready files with a finished size of 4&rdquo;x6&rdquo;. They will work best printed on a matte/dull finish postcard or a natural uncoated cardstock.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to check back next week for a post about all the apps, tools, extensions and hardware that I currently use and have tested over the years.</p>
