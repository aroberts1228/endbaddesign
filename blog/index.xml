      <description>Welcome to the End Bad Design blog.
My name is Anthony Roberts and I hope that anyone involved in creative ministries at their church can benefit from this blog.
Most of you probably attend a church like me and do not have a large budget for your printing, graphic design and other creative services. Maybe you are the entire creative department by yourself.
Regardless of your situation or department size, there are many things you can do to make your church design better.</description>
