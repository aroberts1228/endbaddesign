<h3 id="welcome-to-the-end-bad-design-blog">Welcome to the End Bad Design blog</h3>

<p>My name is Anthony Roberts and I hope that anyone involved in creative ministries at their church can benefit from this blog.</p>

<p>Most of you probably attend a church like me and do not have a large budget for your printing, graphic design and other creative services. Maybe you are the entire creative department by yourself.</p>

<p>Regardless of your situation or department size, there are many things you can do to make your church design better.</p>

<p>We have to admit that for a long time things designed by churches have been pretty terrible. You have seen the flyers and postcards that are missing key information or look like they were printed on the cheapest paper around.</p>

<p>Maybe it is the social media graphics you see posted that would make clip art seem professional.</p>

<p>No matter what it is, there is simply no longer an excuse for bad design. There are so many affordable and even free tools available for use now that anyone can make something decent. Hopefully, this blog will help you in your creative endeavors and take your design to another level.</p>

<h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>

<p>Growing up I was always involved in some form of art even at an early age. I always enjoyed trying new techniques and styles. From calligraphy to graffiti I tried to learn as much as I could and imitate the best of the best.</p>

<p>As I got older and busier I didn&rsquo;t do as much artwork as I had in the past and instead turned my focus to photography. This fascination with taking photos is what would eventually lead me into the journey of graphic design.</p>

<p>I never really intended to become a designer, it was more of something born out of necessity at our church. We didn&rsquo;t have anyone that was a &ldquo;designer&rdquo; and the majority of our materials were made in Word or Publisher. I remember downloading a copy of GIMP because we couldn&rsquo;t afford Photoshop at the time and tried to watch as many tutorials as I could.</p>

<p>Over the years I became pretty decent at making half way good designs and eventually partnered with a good friend of mine to form Rocketpunch Labs LLC where we specialize in Graphic and Website design. Since the formation of our company, I have learned a lot of what looks good, but also a lot of what doesn&rsquo;t work when it comes to church design.</p>

<p>Hopefully, my learning experiences I have gained along the way can help others that may be in the same situation I was in when first venturing into design. Be sure to check back every week for a new post and plenty of free files to help you along the way.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s jump into the adventure together and work to End Bad Design.</p>
